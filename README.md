# How to learn from this repository?

I have created files with numbers from 1 to 4 and you can follow along with me easily. 

# To deploy the app do the following steps...

Go to <a href = "https://share.streamlit.io">Streamlit Login Page</a> and create an account threre through your github login. Then you will have to request for an invite that will allow you to share your applications using Streamlit Share. You will get a confirmation mail with the invite in 48 hours.

Now you have to create a requirements.txt file that will let Streamlit know which packages you are using for your application. To do this:

1. Install pipreqs using `pip install pipreqs`.
2. Then you have to run `pipreqs <location of your project folder>`. If you have installed pipreqs in your project folder itself run `pipreqs ./`. Now wait for a miinute and check whether you have a requirements.txt file in your folder. If yes, then you are good to deploy the app, else you can search for the problem solution on Google or reach out to me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedanthbaliga">LinkedIn</a>
3. Now go back to the Streamlit webiste and click 'New App'
4. Choose your project repository from the dropdown menu, select either main or master and select the file that you want to deploy. In this case `app.py`.
5. Now Click deploy and wait till the processing of the app is finished. 
6. Once you can see the contents of your app, you can use the URL and share it with your friends :)
